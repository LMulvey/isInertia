# isInertia.ts

Updated [Lethargy](https://github.com/d4nyll/lethargy) utility by [d4nyll](https://github.com/d4nyll) that tracks decay of delta values during a wheel event. This is used to determine whether a wheel event is an intentional action by the user, or triggered by inertia from a track pad.

Modified to add support for horizontal scrolling as well.
